      <h3>
        We get it, hiring a web developer or designer can be scary
      </h3>
      <p>
        Do you own a small business without much capital to spend and you're not sure whether hiring a professional is worth it? Already have a Wix, Squarespace or GoDaddy website and you're already making your own promotional materials, but you want to step up your game and you're confused about how much value a professional can add to your business? Maybe you just don't understand the process and you're scared of the unknown? We want our clients to be as comfortable with us as possible. If you're on the fence about hiring a professional (<strong>don't worry - you're not alone!</strong>), we're always here to talk!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Full transparency
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most of our competitors will try to upsell you on extras you probably don't need or won't need for years to come. They'll purposely use industry jargon to confuse you because they know you're not well enough informed on the topic to say no. <strong>If we don't think you need it, we won't try to sell it to you.</strong> It's that simple - we believe in honest client interactions and will always keep your best interests in mind. Confused by something we might say? Ask and we'll be glad to explain!
      </p>
