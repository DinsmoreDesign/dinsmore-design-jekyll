callout: Design & Development - Built for YOU
callout_desc:
  - title: We get it, hiring a designer or web developer can be scary.
    text: Maybe you're a small business without much capital to spend; you're not sure whether hiring a professional is worth it. Maybe you already have a website or you're making your own promotional materials and you're confused about what value a professional can add to your business. Heck, maybe you just don't understand the process and you're scared of the unknown.

  - title: Full transparency
    text: Most of our competitors will try to upsell you on extras you probably don't need through expensive packages, but you might not know enough about them to say no. If we don't think you need it, we won't try to sell it to you. It's that simple - we believe in honest client interactions and will always keep your best interests in mind. Confused by something we might say? Ask and we'll be glad to explain!

  - title: Branding vs Design
    text: Most professional designers are skilled at making attractive graphics and collateral but fall short when it comes to developing a complete brand's identity. At Dinsmore Design, we try to make a clear distinction between a "logo" and an "identity," because we pride ourselves on the research we put into each and every project in order to maximize its potential to YOUR clients. We provide a carefully thought out experience to your clients that reflects your business's target market and core values, not just a pretty graphic to attach to your emails.

  - title: Web Development vs Web Design
    text: We're sure you've seen it. You log onto a website selling "custom website designs" and you're immediately baffled at the price based on what they're offering. Most companies offering these services are web designers who mostly lack the technical skills to develop a website from the ground up and rely on a content management service (such as WordPress) to design your website. While utilizing these systems definitely takes a skill set in itself, the fact of the matter is, these companies are mostly using off-the-shelf themes, slightly editing them and then charging you thousands of dollars for the end result. The advantage of hiring a professional web developer is huge - while a designer might understand the specifics of the software suite, the web developer will understand the underlying code and how it interacts with the server.

  - text: At Dinsmore Design, we offer both services, at different price ranges. Need a fully-customized website built from the ground up, utilizing the latest web technologies? Need to target a specific form-factor and need speed above all else? Building a web app like nothing else? No problem! However, we totally understand that not all businesses need all the bells and whistles and we're glad to help you save your hard-earned cash with and off-the-shelf system. Don't worry, the site will still completely reflect your branding standards. Heck, we'll even teach you how to use the system after it's all set up.
