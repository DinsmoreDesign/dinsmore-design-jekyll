Learning web development can be hard. There are so many different technologies out there that it's *really* hard to figure out what you should be learning. Whether you're just learning for fun, or want to make a career out of it, these resources will help you get a jump-start on your learning:

#### *When* should I hire a designer? ####

  Tools like [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/ "Visit Adobe Spark's website"), [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Visit Canva's website") and [Stencil](https://getstencil.com/ "Visit Stencil's website") are great for social marketing.

#### *Why* should I hire a designer? ####

  These days, it seems like everyone's a "*designer*". From the mom selling t-shirts on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/ "Visit Etsy's website") to earn some extra cash, to the kid down the street who just downloaded the latest version of [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html "Adobe Photoshop") off The Pirate Bay. It can be difficult for a business owner to discern what makes a professional designer standout from the guy offering $5 logos on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/ "Visit Fiverr's website"). Don't get me wrong, some of the artists on Etsy have some great design skills and there's a few guys on Fiverr who actually produce great work - but don't expect to buy a professional logo from them for only a couple bucks.

  Producing good design takes skill. It takes practice and lots of experience to get to the point of producing effective marketing materials. Contrary to popular belief: *design is **far more** than interesting fonts, eye-catching colors and pretty graphics.* The best designers are every bit as good as the best marketer out there, because they know design is a form of marketing, not necessarily art.

  **A designer can help take your brand to the next level by creating a brand image.**
